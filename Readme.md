# Telegram client

## Short description

This Telegram client uses TDlib and can save messages to localstorage (file, or whatever that support interface Storage)

## Long description

I have some important information spreaded by Telegram channels. So, I created useful tool to save those messages to localstate.

## TODO

* Another state storage (sqlite || redis || whatever)
* Separate code to simple functions
* Beer
